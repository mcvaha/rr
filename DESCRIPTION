Reading txt file as data
Sal = read.table("P130.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", dec = "."
, col.names = c("salary", "exper", "educ", "manag"))

all(complete.cases(Sal)) 

#checking if var is qual
is.factor(Sal$educ)

unique(Sal$educ) 

#Encoding educ and manag as qual variable and adding labels
Sal$educ = factor(Sal$educ, levels = c(1, 2, 3) 
,labels = c("HighS", "Bachelor", "Master"))

Sal$manag = factor(Sal$manag, levels = c(0, 1) 
,labels = c("NonMan", "Man"))

levels(Sal$educ) -> groups of qual variable educ

contrasts(Sal$educ) -> we can check reference group like this

Sal$educ = relevel(Sal$educ, ref = "Master") -> changing reference group to Mast

ADDITIVE RELATIONSHIP MODEL
fit = lm(salary ~ educ + manag + exper, data = Sal)
head(model.matrix(fit))
coef(fit) -> difference with reference group

Show that model does not provide correct descr of reality
plot(resid(fit) ~ Sal$exper) -> good model is the one where resid rand distr around 0
